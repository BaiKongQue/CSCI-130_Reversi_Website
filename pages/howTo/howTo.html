			<h2 align="middle" style="margin: 0 auto; font-size: 30px;">Origin</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Reversi
				is an ancient game whose origin is uncertain.

				The oldest references about similar games go back to late in the 19th century; those games had different
				names and their boards had different size or shape.

				In 1870 appeared a similar game using a cross shape board. Subsequently appeared another game played on
				a 8x8 square shape board.

				Description
				Two players take part in this game; they need a board with 64 squares distributed in 8 rows and 8
				columns, and 64 similar pieces of two colours (normally black and white): the obverse in one colour and
				the reversi in the other colour.</p>

			<h2 align="middle" style="margin: 0 auto; font-size: 30px;">Objective</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The
				objective for each of the players is to finish the game with more pieces on the board in his own
				colour than the opponent.

				How the game goes on
				Start of the game

				Before starting players decide which colour will use each of them.

				Next 4 pieces have to be placed in the central squares of the board, so that each pair of pieces of the
				same colour form a diagonal between them.

				The player with black pieces moves first; one only move is made every turn.</p>

			<h2 align="middle" style="margin: 0 auto; font-size: 30px;">Moves</h2>

			<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> A move
				consists in placing from
				outside one piece on the board. Placed pieces
				can never be moved to
				another square later in the game.

				The incorporation of the pieces must be made according to the following rules:

				The incorported piece must outflank one or more of the opponent placed pieces
				To outflank means that a single piece or one straight row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) of pieces
				of the opponent is in both sides next to own pieces, with no empty squares between all those pieces
				The player who makes the move turns the outflanked pieces over, becoming all of them in own pieces
				If there is more than one outflanked row, all the involved pieces in those rows have to be flipped
				If itÂ´s not possible to make this kind of move, turn is forfeited and the opponent repeats another move
				Final
				The game is over when all the squares of the board are taken or none of the players can move.

				In any case the winner is the player who has more pieces on the board.

				The game ends in a draw when both players have the same number of pieces on the board.</p>
